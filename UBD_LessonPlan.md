# UBD Lesson Plan
**John Ailor**

*EDUC-314*

## Stage 1 - Identify Desired Results
### Established goals

>S3.A.2.2.1: Identify appropriate tools or instruments for specific tasks, and describe 			the information they provide (i.e., measuring [length—ruler; mass— balance scale] and making observations [hand lenses—very small objects]).

>S3.A.1.1.2: Identify examples of common technological changes, past and present, in the community (e.g., energy production, transportation, communication, recycling).

### Questions that will be considered
Essential questions are the questions students should be able to answer if they understand the enduring understandings.  The essential questions for this unit are as follows:

1. What is programming?
2. How do the programs around us affect us?
3. What simple things can students do with programming to make their lives easier? 
4. How do we write a simple program?
5. How has changing technology affected our lives?


### What understandings are desired
Students will understand that...

1. Programming is anything we do to give instructions to computers.
2. Programming plays a crucial role in the modern age.
3. Almost any task can be simplified by incorporating a programming element.
4. Sometimes the programming of a task takes longer than the task itself
	* [ex.](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/is_it_worth_the_time.png)
5. Programming skills that will be learned:
	* The basics of formatting
	* Conditional Logic (if, if..else, and, or)
	* Loops (for 1..100)
	* Standard Output (printing to the page).
6. Changes in technology change the way the world functions and make's life easier in many ways.

### What key knowledge will students acquire as a result of this unit
#### Students will know
1. How different elements of programming works
2. How to problem solve to create a program
3. Basic programming algorithms
4. Basic programming skills

#### Students will be able to
1. Write a simple program

## Stage 2 - Determine acceptable evidence	
	
### What evidence will show that students understand
**Performance Tasks:**

Two performance tasks will be used to measure student's ability to write code at the end of the month. Both will be graded with the second rubric below, and as many intermediate tasks as possible will include a portion which can be graded using the first rubric. 

1. Students will be asked to write a small program in which they can answer multiple choice questions asked throughout the rest of the year by pressing one of 4 buttons during a prompt given on the board/powerpoint during other lessons. Some hardware and software will be provided, specifically so that students are not tasked with putting hardware circuits together. Each student will be given their own hardware set and asked to write code which can be executed on the hardware. The coding task itself is not a difficult task, and uses only conditional statements- any provided code and libraries that they need to interact with will be explained- which will also lead into discussion of libraries in programming (code that other people wrote which the students are able to use), and their code will be executed inside of a "Virtual Box", which allows students to write code that can not mess-up/break the rest of the system. 

2. Students will be asked to write another simple program which walks through several mathematical concepts- addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and comparators (i.e. > < =). The functionality of this program will be that students will be able to input a whole number, and the program should:
	1. Output the number as a string (ex. 500 -> Five Hundred)
	2. Decide if the number is even or odd
	3. Compare the number to the previous number (greater than, less than, equal to)
	4. Treat the number as a currency amount amount of pennies and create change from standard bills and coins. 
	5. Find the factors of that number using a loop
	6. Any other grade appropriate mathematical concepts that are tied into their mathematics lesson. 

For both assignments, appropriate amounts of code will be given as an outline for students to work with, and the students will not be asked to perform any tasks that are outside the scope of their learning from other subjects. 

The first task helps students to understand programming better, as well as can be used to keep track of student's understanding level and determine which students are falling behind/consistently wrong, and which ones are excelling during the lessons. The Multiple choice questions that this system is used to answer will be integrated into the curriculum during other subjects, so that students can interact even during lectures. 

The second task is designed to help students develop a better understanding of programming, and a deeper understanding of the concepts being covered in mathematics, hopefully so that they can understand how the math works- opposed to just repeating what they are told is the correct answer. 

### Assessment Rubric
This rubric is not just for any single project, but instead all lab sheets and homework should be formatted using markup and Markup will be considered as 10% of every grade. One or two assignments (listed above) may require only Markup syntax as a skill, and will be graded with this rubric as well, however they will not carry as much weight as other assignments in the class.

| Area | Exemplary (5/10) | Acceptable (2.5/10) | Needs Work (1/10) |
|------|------|-----|-----|
| Syntax of Elements | Properly formats pages and can properly display all elements that have been discussed in class | Can properly format most of the elements that were discussed in class | Unable to properly format most of the elements that were shown in class.|
| Element Usage | Demonstrates an understanding of when certain elements (i.e. tables or numbered lists) should be used in place of other elements. | Sometimes uses the wrong element type, but is mostly correct | Appears to lack the understanding of when certain element types are needed opposed to others.| 

--- 
The below rubric is for specific programming assignments that arise during the course. Only a few of these programs will be the entire assignment, most will be supplementary to another learning task. Students will be introduced to concepts in programming that will be helpful for the task they are under taking. 

| Area | Exemplary (25%) | Acceptable (12.5%) | Needs Work (5%) |
|------|------|-----|-----|
| Specifications | The program meets all of the points outlined in the assignment and does not miss any of the specifications required. | The program has only a few missing specifications, or some specifications do not perform as expected | The program does not meet most of the specifications, but does perform the same underlying functionality |
| Readability/Documentation | The code is readable, and a README file is included to outline how the program works or should be used. Code is well commented, explaining difficult or confusing lines. The comments/README show that the student has a strong understanding of what the program's purpose is | Student missed one of the previous points, or the comments/README do not sufficiently show that the student has an understanding of the code | Code is undocumented or the documentation is incomplete. 
| Runtime | The program executes without error if the directions are followed | The program is able to execute under most circumstances, but may crash or hang during some operations | The program does not run |
| Robustness | The program is able to handle any inputs without a problem | Some program inputs cause error or cause the program to execute improperly | The correct inputs cause the program to crash sometimes. | 
| Efficiency (For Harder tasks) | Program is able to execute in an efficient manor- the code does not slow down inappropriately | The program does not execute efficiently, and the README file is able to explain why the program is slower than expected | The program does not run efficiently and the README does not give any explanation for this |



### What other evidence needs to be collected in light of stage 1 desired results
#### Student self assessment and reflection

* Essay Portion
	* Students will be asked to write an essay (in Markdown syntax) in order to convince their future teachers that they should be taught programming in future classes. This essay will help cover any questions that are more generally related to technology and programming, but are not programming specific tasks. 
	* This portion also ties into their writing section and can have a research component if that is grade level appropriate (or a research component that is grade level appropriate), and will count as a persuasive writing piece for the grade level. 
* Time Determination Program
	* Students will be asked to write a very simple program to determine if a given task is worth automating, based on guessing the amount of time it would take to write the program, and how much time would be saved
	* This concept will be introduced and emphasized to avoid the misunderstanding that creating a program can solve any problem (ex. It would probably take longer to write a program to do homework than to just do the homework assignment). 
	* This portion again will tie into mathematics including fractions, division, and multiplication.

## Stage 3 - Plan Learning Experiences
What sequence of teaching and learning experiences will equip students to engage with, develop, and demonstrate the desired understandings?  Use the following sheet to list the key teaching and learning activities in sequence.  Code each entry with the appropriate initials of WHERETO elements.

| | | Lesson |
|---|---|-----|
| 1  | W	| Students will be introduced to the concept of programming and markup and what it is	|
| 2  | W	| Students will be introduced to the basic principles of how to make their own markdown	|
| 3  | E2 | Students will be introduced to the basic principles of how to make their own program	|
| 4  | W | Students will be taught about existing programs and how they interact with them on a daily basis	|
| 5  | E | Students will be shown good and bad coding practices so that they are aware of how to program in an effective manor to receive a good grade	|
| 6  | E | Students will be taught why good programming practices are important and how good code is helpful	|
| 7  | E2 | Students will be asked to implement concepts they have learned in various programs, and tie them into other lesson subjects so that they make the connection between what they are doing and the real-world	|
| 8  | H | Students will make fun applications as well as practical tools- for instance, games can be easily built using programming languages like scratch- or javascript game engines.	|
| 9  | R | Students will be asked to revisit their code on multiple occasions in order to reinforce both new and old concepts	|
| 10 | T | Students who of different learning types will be allowed to watch relevant videos, lectures, or read about the subject matter	|
| 11 | T | Students will be permitted to do different levels of program difficulty depending on their performance and ability	|
| 12 | O | Students will be slowly introduced to concepts which build upon each other, and assessed at various times throughout the learning cycle.	|
| 13 | R | Students will be asked evaluate existing programs so they can see how programs work	|
| 14 | H | Hopefully the ability to see their work immediately translated into usable items will be enough to hook some students- for others there are games.	|



### Calendar Of Events

| Week Number | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday |
|-------------|--------|---------|-----------|----------|--------|
| 1 | The first day will be dedicated to an introduction to what programming is and the basic parts of code and computers | The second day will be an introduction to basic programming concepts and how each of them is used- this lesson will focus on markdown | The third day will focus on markdown as a tool for writing, and students will be asked to provide several writing samples in the form of markdown- this will primarily be a writing intensive lesson | The fourth day will be more advanced concepts of markdown- like rendering into HTML, and how those concepts are important | The last day will be for fun, and students will be asked to make a single page about themselves using markdown- and be able to choose from some pre-made formats that they can use to make their page more interesting! |
| 2 | The lesson today will be an introduction to Javascript code, and will be a basic lesson on the syntax and what the elements of the syntax mean. This will be tied into Markup and how the syntax of that is important as well | Today the students will write their first "Hello World" program | The students will learn more in depth programming concepts and apply them throughout the day | Students will be given a series of programming problems based on what they have learned to date, and be expected to work in groups to write their programs | Students will be given the hardware necessary to make their first project, and will be able to work on the project in groups, but will be expected to return their own work. |
| 3 | Students will be introduced to more concepts of how programming is used around them | Students will start the program that is based on the mathmatics lessons, and be expected to add to/edit their code as the year progresses | Students will be given an assignment to manipulate their Markup using a program that they write and will be able to see results on the screen. | Students will be given an introduction to how video games work, with lots of examples of games that they enjoy playing- including some game-play in class- with the occasional multiple choice question (given using the hardware project they made earlier) so as to engage them in the game, as well as force them to pay attention to the underlying technology  | Students will be given an introduction to Game Scripting, and given a few rudimentary tasks to complete within a Game engine |
| 4 | Students will be able to create their own game (with a large amount of direction) and will spend the entire week on building this simple game | Students will be given base art assets to work with and be given direction on how to edit those art assets for their own games. | Students will be given time to work on their games with oversight from the teacher | Students will be again given time to work on their games with oversight from the teacher | students will be given more time to work on their games, and at the end of the day they will be given the option to play other student's games (if the other student's are willing to let them play) | 

*As a note, any programs used to write code or create their games will be available at home as well as at school so that students are able to create their game outside of the classroom if they desire*










### Incorporation of Six Facets of Learning
#### Explanation
Students will hopefully be able to demonstrate an explanation of the concepts through their various READMEs for each programming assignment, as well as through the paper they are asked to compose. 

#### Interpretation
Periodically students will be asked to identify the (Very basic concepts) being used in a functioning program- or website that is being used during the course of other material. If students can identify that a website uses certain markup elements, or if they can identify that a button may use conditional logic, then they are able to interpret what they have learned.

#### Application
Even though example code will be provided, students will be able to apply their knowledge to expand that code into a more robust program. Some students may be able to introduce features that they find useful, without being asked to do so. 

#### Perspective
Students will be introduced to several different methods of performing certain tasks (i.e. while vs for, switch vs if..else). Some example code will be provided that uses one method or the other, and students will be asked to defend why a certain methodology is better than another, or if they are both equally useful. 

#### Empathy
Students will be asked about certain problems that they wish they could write code for (ex. making breakfast in the morning, doing their homework, taking out the trash) and asked to explain briefly why they think that a professional has not already created a program to perform this task. 

#### Self-Knowledge
Periodically students will be asked to redo small programs using the new concepts that they have learned. By using their previous work they are given the option to update their old code, without being forced to- and they are able to see how new things they have learned can make their next program better.
